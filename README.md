# BSOD-Custom-Parameter

This repo was made by someone who has 0 knowledge of C++. and somehow succeeded in making this program display custom parameter that you want.
The core resources were taken from https://github.com/lzcapp/NotMe-BSOD.

# Note : The custom parameter will only work in NT 5.0~6.1 type BSOD screens(like in Windows XP - Windows 7 (or early windows 8 beta builds).
