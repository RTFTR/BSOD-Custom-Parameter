# BSOD-Custom-Parameter

This repo was made by someone who has 0 knowledge of C++. and somehow succeeded in making this program display custom parameter that you want.
The core resources were taken from https://github.com/lzcapp/NotMe-BSOD.

# Note : The custom parameter will only work in NT 5.0~6.1 type BSOD screens(like in Windows XP - Windows 7 (or early windows 8 beta builds). In other words, the custom text you set to display on the blue screen will not work starting Windows 8, as blue screen texts are hardcoded from this version.

But causing the bsod itself will work in any versions! theoretically past versions of windows will also work but you'll need tons of runtime settings/compatibility settings in order to make the program actually run on them.

## Limitations:
You can only edit the parameter, error code directly in the project itself, and you need VS2022 with C++ support to compile it.

The upcoming updates will include user-friendly? features. stay tuned!
